# So

it's "sooner with a following wind". Things went relatively smoothly after authoring yesterday's post and the unordered list is done. Time for the next step (in a stream of consciousness, thinking out loud kind of way).

## Identifying Subject Areas

I think this falls into 3 main categories

- Game Logic
- Visual Assets
- Audio Assets

### Game Logic

I can make a rudimentary game in any language. But, looking to the future I need good support, both in terms of free learning resources and available software; I think it is better to have objects and not use them than the other way round; and, I want to be able to deploy on as many platforms as possible.

The first criteria rules out obscure languages and also [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - it certainly has potential, but the support I need is just not there yet. Moreover, quick searches tend to turn up either [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) or [C++](https://isocpp.org/) as candidate languages - likely because both are supported by the [Unity](https://unity.com/products/unity-engine) and [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) game engines and [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US) only supports the later. I know I could easily dig deeper for more, but the point is to make finding resources easy.

Both of those languages work with objects so no worries there.

But for platforms - last time I tried it was a lot of effort to get `C#` to play nicely with the Linux Kernel (I assume its similar for other Unix like systems - Mac, I'm looking at you). It's part of the `.Net framework` and comes with MicroSoft baggage. It is nearly as bad getting `C++` to work on Windows (actually, its really easy if you just install Visual Studio - thanks but nah) but not quite.

However, there is more to learning a language than just understanding the building block. From experience I know I really struggle with design and planning, especially as projects increase in scope and size. So, I should also look into Software Engineering & Game Design, possibly Design Patterns as well. My pre-existing well of knowledge is not as full in this area. I don't think I know what I don't know.

### Visual Assets

Lets break that down, one more time...

#### 2D

At a technological level this area is restricted by economic concerns - I'm not paying for Adobe. As far as I know that limits me to using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) and [Krita](https://krita.org/en/). The first two I have some experience with, the last is a mystery to me.

This is the half that presents a relatively simple solution - find resources to familiarise myself with the new software and expand my existing knowledge and skills. I believe that Krita integrates both vector and raster paradigms so, once mastered, it should actually replace the need for the other two.

There's also the proficiency aspect - in which I am fundamentally lacking. I struggle in the first instance to execute my ideas and then I tend to ‘over engineer’ my design continuing to add detail when I should stop. Practice, practice, practice? Maybe. But, there might be some design process I can implement as a starting point or a guide. Again I don't know what I don't know.


#### 3D

Once again, my commitment to free software narrows my choices greatly. It's basically all about [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). Mostly the same as 2D but only one software platform to concern myself with.

There's also, texturing, baking, low poly, high poly, poly wanna cracker and whatever else I've forgotten. Best start with software proficiency. Assuming design principles are the same in any number of dimensions I can build my skill set from there.

### Audio Assets

Even further outside my experience and comfort zone. And, risking approaching peak repetition. Apparently I need a DAW - either [ardour](https://ardour.org/) or [LMMS](https://lmms.io/) are the FOSS offerings. There's not a lot to go off. The LMMS manual looks slightly nicer - better presented and easier to read.

And then ... audio engineering? I don't even know...

## Conclusion


That's eight subject areas. More than enough to get started with. So next step is finding learning resources for the following:

> **SUBJECT AREAS**
> > * C++ Language
> > * Software Engineering
> > * Game Design
> > * Design Patterns
> > * Krita
> > * Blender
> > * Graphic Design
> > * LMMS
> {: .prompt-info}
> &nbsp;
{: .shadow}

Doesn't feel like much of an achievement. But, its one more coherent step - on a Saturday no less.
