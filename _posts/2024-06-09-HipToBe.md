# Where was I...

This is going to be a lot like yesterday. Stream of consciousness. Degrading as I get out of my comfort zone and into the virgin territory of this brave new world. Onward.

## My Rules

* Free - at least to me
* Learn by doing - I don't learn hands on skills by just reading
* Length - I like the idea of comprehensive, but obviously need a certain level of expediency, [see here]({% post_url 2024-06-07-HaHa %}).

## Where To Start

In priority order:

* **Personal Experience** - assuming I have any, may as well leverage what I know.
* **inLearning** - I have an account as part of a course I was on, I should try to get some use out of it (I think it runs out in a month or two).
* **Search Engines** - Been pretty bad recently but lets say [Google](https://www.google.com), [Bing](https://www.bing.com/) & [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/)
* **YouTube** - Lots of good knowledge, but very rarely does it include practical exercises; something of a last resort.

## Subject Areas

### C++ Language

Been here before. There are all sorts of resources I know about without even looking. Without a doubt the most comprehensive I have found is [LearnCPP.com](https://www.learncpp.com/). Entirely fits my criteria but, it is somewhat overwhelming in its comprehension.

in Learning has two learning paths [Getting started with C++](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/getting-started-with-c-plus-plus?u=78575546) and [Master C++](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/master-c-plus-plus?u=78575546). They certainly sound promising. They have challenge sections to tick "learn by doing". Broken into courses and lessons with a total time of 29hrs - that will just be the course material not including time spent working on challenges.

### Software Engineering

EdX offer a MicroMasters in [Software Development Foundations](https://www.edx.org/masters/micromasters/ubcx-software-development-foundations?webview=false&campaign=Software+Development+Foundations&source=edx&product_category=micromasters&placement_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edx.org%2Fschool%2Fubcx) from the University of British Columbia. I've started it a few times. Really good content - again. But, starting to show its age amd partially behind a paywall making getting the most out of it troublesome.

inLearning has a few candidates in this field. However, the [Programming Foundations](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-programmer-foundations?u=78575546) learning path seems the most on point in terms of what I am trying to improve - it even includes a section on [Design Patterns](#design-patterns).

### Game Design

No official learning paths on inLearning but a short three course series from industry veteran [Brenda Romero](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/brenda-romero?u=78575546).

Other courses seem more focuses on technology specific learning - like Unity et al.

### Design Patterns

Already covered. Can re-evaluate and look for further resources if necessary.

### Krita

From the search engines it seems like there are two main repositories of information: the [Krita User Manual](https://docs.krita.org/en/user_manual.html) and YouTube. Reading the manual will require I permanently split my visual attention. Whereas, videos might mean I can visually focus on the software while absorbing information aurally. Also, there is a [Krita Tutorial for Beginners 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viTuqB3Qofo&list=PLo_kbikcLfN-4kZjxDr0k4pmFJa147JTd) 9 videos about 90mins total, so not too much time wasted if it proves fruitless.

> Having decided to focus on Krita, inLearning has short 'Essential' Training for Inkscape and GIMP

### Blender

I've tried [Blender Guru](https://www.youtube.com/user/AndrewPPrice) and [Grant Abbitt](https://www.youtube.com/@grabbitt) on YouTube with limited success - slightly lacking in long term structure.

But, 4hrs of [Blender 4.0 Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/blender-4-0-essential-training/introducing-blender-4-0-for-beginners?u=78575546) and that creator has some additional videos specifically about character animation.

And, [Darrin Lile](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/darrin-lile?u=78575546) has some videos on hard surface modelling, character rigging and sculpting then texturing game assets. A bit old now, but could be worth a look.

### Graphic Design

Slightly surprised how many learning paths are available.

I'm starting from nothing but [Advance Your Skills in Graphic Design](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/darrin-lile?u=78575546) has promising course titles. Less design more skill based is [Improve Your Drawing and Painting Sills](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/improve-your-drawing-and-painting-skills?u=78575546) definitely something I need. Then stuff on career development, business, using AI (because of course) and how to design a logo (maybe later)

### LMMS

[Explore Music Production](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/explore-music-production?u=78575546) looks to give a good grounding in the general area but doesn't look at LMMS specifically as far as I can tell.

Software wise the search engines are providing the same general pattern of results as for Krita - manual and YouTube. The manual has a [digital](https://docs.lmms.io/user-manual) and [pdf](https://lmms.io/pdf/lmms-manual-0.4.12.pdf) version. Digital seems better - layout is easier for me to read and navigation is built in. Plus a specific section on [video tutorials](https://docs.lmms.io/user-manual/7-resources/7.3-video-tutorials) (although those videos are a decade old.).

On YouTube directly TJ free has an eighteen video (approx 3hrs of content) [LMMS Tutorials playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrMTlpeSw8Y&list=PLqazFFzUAPc4K1To5JTtR3cskcdRifM1M) - that one is 5 years old.

Filtering for videos less than a year old there are two 10 minute offerings - [Getting Started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr-QL9Fii6Y) and [Tutorial For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxufVnnHG60)

## Next Week

It's going to be a bit 'suck it and see'. Below is a list of what I think are the best starting points based on the above. I want to get a little taste to evaluate their suitability more fully - especially in the case of LMMS. I think I can guarantee about 25 hours of good work in the week, but, this will also be a good way of determining how accurate that assessment is. Rather than push it to the line, say, 2.5 hours (or, 2 hours 15, plus 15 minutes to record in this devlog) for each area. That gives leeway and time to do another major evaluation at the end of the week. No need to get bogged down in organising a schedule - just do things in the order I've written them down.
