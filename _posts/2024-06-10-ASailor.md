# The First Day Of The Rest Of This DevLog

Aiming for 5 hours total. Half `C++` from [Getting started with C++](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/getting-started-with-c-plus-plus?u=78575546) and half [Programming Foundations](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-programmer-foundations?u=78575546).

To quote a short, fat, fictional plumber/racing driver/sports star "Let'sa go".

## C++

### Review

My attention wandered, but it is impossible to say for sure if that is as a result of the content or just a function of me today.

I feel like the course bounces between assuming I have quite a lot of previous programming experience (which the intro does say is expected) and assuming I know absolutely nothing.

Probably fairly good for quickly identifying which areas I actually need to work on. Especially seeing as many of the videos conclude by directing me to [CPP Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/) for more information. Feels really 'off' but looking at the overview it is a crash course that lays the foundations for the rest of the path. Can't go quickly and expect a lot of depth.

## That's All She Wrote

I didn't get the second half of my earlier plan done. Sometimes that's just how it goes. Maybe even my scaled back plans will prove too ambitious. In this context the attention was probably a me thing.
