A DevLog/Blog documenting a Game Dev journey.

Starting from an unfocused amateur with a abnormally wide breadth of knowledge the hope is this style of documentation will provide the required impetus to get from floundering to finished project.

Very much a work-in-progress at this point. But, each step is an opportunity to learn something. Even if a failure highlights what not to do.

Slightly separate to this, and in much need of eloquent refinement, is a commitment to ethical practices:

- **No micro-transactions!**
- **No DRM!**
- **Only Full Games!**
- **Gameplay first!**

No more excuses.

We can have nice things.
